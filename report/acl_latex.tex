  Languages change through time and detecting lexical semantic change in languages provides better understanding across different cultures, regions, and time spans.
  Determining the ground truth of languages semantic change requires high linguistics expertise. 
  Therefore, this work aim to detect the lexical semantic change between two corpora in an unsupervised manner.
  This work leverages the fact that language models learn the word usage in a given corpora. 
  Once a word undergoes any semantic change, the language models trained on the corpus change accordingly.
  I implement this motivation via influence functions to efficiently approximate the model trained on different corpus configuratinos.
  In the SemEval2020 benchmark, the proposed approach, InfDetect, achieves ?? accuracy in the binary task, outperforming ?? from 22 teams in the SemEval2020 chanllenges.
  In the ranking task, InfDetect achieves spearman correlation ??, outperforming ?? from 22 teams in the SemEval2020 chanllenges.
