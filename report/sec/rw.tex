\subsection{Unsupervised Lexical Semantic Change Detection}




There are two strands of approach for LSC detection in the computational field.
The first strand deals with words as a whole and determines change based on a word's dominant sense~\cite{dominant-sense1,dominant-sense2}.
The second strand deals with a word's sense individually~\cite{second-strand1,second-strand2}.
These two correspond to two tasks in SemEval2020~\cite{semeval2020}: binary classification and ranking problem.
Prior work~\cite{temporalteller} leverages synchronic word embeddings and computes the distance between two corpora.
On the contrary, ~\cite{diachronic-survey} surveys approaches that use diachronic word embeddings to perform semantic shifts detection.
In this work, I go from a different direction: I investigate the model's changes w.r.t. the target words by utilizing influence functions~\cite{influence_fn}.
