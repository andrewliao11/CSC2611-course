\section{Discussion}

The proposed approach shows that the influences function is highly correlated with LCS, achieving 0.7 in binary classification and 0.59 in spearman's correlation in the ranking problem.
However, the estimation of the influence function is time-consuming and not stable.
For each term in Eq.~\ref{eq:influence_fn_mlm}, it takes more than 20 minuites to compute.
The bottleneck is the approximation of inverse HVP. 
The approximation is done recursively, so it's not parallelizable. In our case, it takes 10000 recursion steps to reach convergence.
Additionally, the computation is not stable for some words (e.g., ``trump''), leading to divergence.
The computational expensive and instability hamper it from performing LCS in a continuous fashion. For example, monitoring the LCS for an extended period will be prohibitively computationally expensive.
